# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This sentiment analysis project utilizes various Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and open-source technologies to analyze news articles. The project includes the integration of popular libraries such as spaCy, TextBlob, NLTK, Transformers, PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas. The goal is to provide insightful analysis, including sentiment classification (negative, neutral, positive), polarity, subjectivity, and word counts for the most frequently used words.

## Technologies Used

- **spaCy:** Used for advanced natural language processing tasks.
- **TextBlob:** Employed for simple and effective sentiment analysis.
- **NLTK:** Integrated for various NLP tasks, including tokenization and stopwords removal.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face):** Utilized pre-trained models for advanced sentiment analysis.
- **PyTorch:** Employed for deep learning-based sentiment analysis tasks.
- **NumPy:** Used for efficient numerical operations.
- **Pandas:** Employed for data manipulation and analysis.

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification:** Negative, neutral, and positive sentiment labels.
- **Polarity:** Quantification of the emotional tone of the text.
- **Subjectivity:** Measurement of the subjectiveness of the text.
- **Word Counts:** Analysis of the most frequently used words.

## Project Structure

- **data:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- **src:** Source code for the sentiment analysis project.
- **results:** Output and results obtained from the analysis.
